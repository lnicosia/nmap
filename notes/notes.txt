###### Features to implement before defence

# Flags d'opti (remove -g ?)

# Remove useless comments before push

# Put all scantypes by default if none are specified (subject restriction) (sources/parse_option_line.c:397)

# Must recheck if segfault/leak when thread creation fail

# Check allowed functions

# Print down and errors if 0 port were scanned

# Check scan broadcast and gateway without privileges

# sudo ./ft_nmap 192.168.255/10 -t 250 -v DEBUG -p 1 infinite loop ?

# sudo ./ft_nmap 192.168.255/255 -t 250 -v DEBUG -p 1 segfault

##### IN THE FUTURE, MORE FEATURES TO COME

## NEW FEATURES
# Parse initial, min and max rtt
# Version detection
# OS detection
# Non root (connect) host discovery

## OPTIMISATION
# Use the same port structure for all IPs, ft_nmap will use way less memory to perform scans
# Remove protocol checks in scans when possible (checking if protocol is tcp for a tcp socket is useless)

## OTHER
# No need to malloc saddr, daddr structs (sources/list.c:22)
# Print TIMESTAMP in craft packet (sources/craft_packet.c)
