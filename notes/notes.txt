###### Features to implement before defence

# Flags d'opti (remove -g ?)

# Remove useless comments before push

# Put all scantypes by default if none are specified (subject restriction) (sources/parse_option_line.c:397)

# Must recheck if segfault/leak when thread creation fail

# Update -h before push

# Check allowed functions

# Option to disable host dicovery

# Check ip counter + use max_ips

# remember invalid ips to print them at the end

##### IN THE FUTURE, MORE FEATURES TO COME

## NEW FEATURES
# Parse initial, min and max rtt
# Version detection
# OS detection
# Non root (connect) host discovery

## OPTIMISATION
# Use the same port structure for all IPs, ft_nmap will use way less memory to perform scans
# Remove protocol checks in scans when possible (checking if protocol is tcp for a tcp socket is useless)

## OTHER
# No need to malloc saddr, daddr structs (sources/list.c:22)
# Print TIMESTAMP in craft packet (sources/craft_packet.c)
