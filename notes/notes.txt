#### Opti ####
Do not identify the services in each thread during runtime but before.
Going through the lists in every thread is slow. + the locking, and we do it two times:
when the thread is searching for a scan to do, and when the thread updates a scan it received.
So maybe use arrays or feed the threads with what scan they must do so they don't need to
search themselves?
Receiving in the threads is slow but it is necessary to receive soon enough after sending
otherwise we may lose the answers

# Do we really need to lock when saving scan results (check this with the future refactor)?

# Remove useless comments before push

# Allow 1024 ports max

# Scans
All scans are consistant but UDP

# Do not forget to put all scantypes by default if none are specified (subject restriction)

# must recheck if segfault/leak when thread creation fail

# remove protocol checks in scans when possible (checking if protocol is tcp for a tcp socket is useless)

# UDP speed: scanning 1000 ports at once is slow due to icmp limiting but
scanning multiple hosts is no big deal

# TODO: Include dynamic timeout in threads
