==== SCAN TYPES ====
Mandatory:
SYN -sS SUDO
NULL -sN SUDO
ACK -sA SUDO
FIN -sF SUDO
XMAS -sX SUDO
UDP -sU SUDO

Bonus:
TCP -sT USER

By default, when non root, nmap is performing TCP scan (-sT)
when root, nmap is performing a SYN scan (-sS)

== SYN ==
https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html
= OPEN =
	1. Send a TCP packet with the SYN flag on port X
	2. Host responds with SYN / ACK flags, meaning that the port is open
	3. Send a RST packet to reset connection
= CLOSED =
	1. Send a TCP packet with the SYN flag on port X
	2. Host responds with a RST packet
= FILTERED =
	1. Send a TCP packet with the SYN flag on port X
	2. Host does not respond
	3. Send a SYN packet again
	4. If another time out, the port is tag as filtered
	(Nmap will also consider a port filtered if it receives certain ICMP error messages back)
